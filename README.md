Automatic Video Library Manager for TV Shows. It watches for new episodes of your favorite shows, and when they are posted it does its magic. [Sickrage](https://sickrage.github.io/)

## Usage

### Media Folder Structure

The containers expect a similar structure with Downloads, Incomplete, Movies, TVShows and Concerts directories on your drive.

    /mnt/external/Downloads/
                            /Incomplete
                            /Movies
                            /TVShows
                  /Movies/
                  /TVShows/
                  /Concerts/

To make all applications behave similarly, the external volume will be mounted on `/volumes/media` in the container.

    export MEDIA=/mnt/1TB-WDred

```
    docker volume create sickrage_config
    docker run -d \
    --name=sickrage \
    --restart=unless-stopped \
    --net=mediaserver \
    -v sickrage_config:/config \
    -v $MEDIA:/volumes/media \
    -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
    -e PGID=1000 -e PUID=1000  \
    -p 8081:8081 \
    carlosedp/sickrage
```

## Parameters

`The parameters are split into two halves, separated by a colon, the left hand side representing the host and the right the container side. 
For example with a port -p external:internal - what this shows is the port mapping from internal to external of the container.
So -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080
http://192.168.x.x:8080 would show you what's running INSIDE the container on port 80.`


* `-p 8081` - the port(s)
* `-v /config` - where sickrage should store config files. Defaults to a Docker volume
* `-v $MEDIA:/volumes/media` - your media folder.
* `-e PGID` for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` for UserID - see below for explanation

It is based on alpine linux with s6 overlay, for shell access whilst the container is running do `docker exec -it sickrage /bin/sh`.

### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" â„¢.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`. To find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id <dockeruser>
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

## Setting up the application 

Web interface is at `<your ip>:8081` , set paths for downloads, tv-shows to match docker mappings via the webui.

## Info

* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime `docker logs -f sickrage`.

* container version number 

`docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' sickrage`

* image version number

`docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' linuxserver/sickrage`
